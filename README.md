- üìà **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates during download with cancellation support
- üåç **Cross-Platform**: Includes binaries for Windows, macOS, and Linux

## System Requirements

### Minimum Requirements
- **Geneious Prime**: Version 2024.0 or later
- **Operating System**: 
  - Windows 10 or later (64-bit)
  - macOS 10.14 (Mojave) or later
  - Linux (64-bit distributions)
- **RAM**: 4 GB minimum
- **Storage**: Sufficient space for temporary files during download
- **Internet**: Stable connection for NCBI SRA database access

### Recommended Specifications
- **RAM**: 8 GB or more for large datasets
- **Storage**: SSD with ample free space (downloads can be large)
- **Network**: Broadband connection for faster downloads

## Installation

### Method 1: Download from Releases (Recommended)

1. Download the latest `NcbiSraSearch.gplugin` from the [Releases](https://github.com/dholab/geneious-plugin-sra-search/releases) page
2. In Geneious Prime, go to **Tools ‚Üí Plugins**
3. Click **Install plugin from a gplugin file** 
4. Select the downloaded `NcbiSraSearch.gplugin` file
5. Restart Geneious Prime when prompted

### Method 2: Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dholab/geneious-plugin-sra-search.git
cd geneious-plugin-sra-search

# Build the plugin
ant clean
ant create-plugin

# The plugin will be created as dist/NcbiSraSearch.gplugin
```

After building, follow the installation steps from Method 1 using your locally built `.gplugin` file.

## Quick Start

### Basic SRA Search and Download

1. **Access the Plugin**: In the Sources panel, locate "NCBI SRA Search" with a database icon
2. **Search for Data**: 
   - Click on the SRA Search to activate
   - Enter search terms (e.g., `SRR11192680`, `Homo sapiens`, or any NCBI query)
   - Press Enter or click Search
3. **Download Results**:
   - Select desired SRA records from results
   - Click "Download FASTQ Data"
   - Monitor progress in the Operations panel

### Example Search Queries

- **Specific Accession**: `SRR11192680`
- **Organism**: `Escherichia coli`
- **Study**: `PRJNA613958`
- **Technology**: `Illumina AND RNA-seq`
- **Date Range**: `Homo sapiens AND 2024[PDAT]`

## Usage Guide

### Searching SRA

The plugin supports all standard NCBI SRA search syntax:

1. **Simple Searches**: Enter organism names, accession numbers, or keywords
2. **Boolean Operators**: Use AND, OR, NOT for complex queries
3. **Field Tags**: Use `[ORGN]`, `[ACCN]`, `[TITL]` for specific field searches
4. **Wildcards**: Use `*` for partial matches

### Understanding Search Results

Results display includes:
- **Accession**: SRA run accession number
- **Title**: Experiment title
- **Organism**: Source organism
- **Platform**: Sequencing platform used
- **Layout**: Single or paired-end
- **Spots**: Number of reads
- **Bases**: Total base count
- **Published**: Release date

### Download Options

When downloading SRA data:
- **Automatic Paired-End Detection**: Properly imports paired reads
- **Quality Scores**: Preserves original quality information
- **Metadata Integration**: Attaches all available metadata to sequences
- **Progress Monitoring**: Real-time download status with ability to cancel

## Technical Details

### Bundled Binaries

The plugin includes pre-compiled `fasterq-dump` binaries from NCBI SRA Toolkit:

| Platform | Binary | Version | Architecture |
|----------|--------|---------|--------------|
| Windows | `fasterq-dump.exe` | 2.11.3 | x86_64 |
| macOS | `fasterq-dump` | 2.11.3 | Universal |
| Linux | `fasterq-dump` | 2.11.3 | x86_64 |

### API Integration

The plugin uses NCBI E-utilities API:
- **ESearch**: Query execution against SRA database
- **ESummary**: Metadata retrieval for search results
- **Rate Limiting**: Respects NCBI's 3 requests/second limit
- **Error Handling**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff

### Build Requirements

To build from source:
- Java 8 or later
- Apache Ant
- Geneious Plugin Development Kit (included in `lib/`)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Plugin Not Appearing
- Ensure Geneious Prime 2024.0 or later is installed
- Verify plugin installation in Tools ‚Üí Plugins
- Restart Geneious Prime after installation

#### Download Failures
- Check internet connection stability
- Verify sufficient disk space for temporary files
- Some older SRA entries may be unavailable
- Try downloading fewer files simultaneously

#### Performance Issues
- Large datasets require more RAM (increase in Geneious preferences)
- SSD storage recommended for better performance
- Download speed limited by NCBI servers
